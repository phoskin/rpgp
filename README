We'll recursively encrypt or decrypt files with GPG

OMG HELP!!!1

Okey, time to read the manual:

 -i <directory>
    Input directory. Must exist. Required always
 -o <directory>
    Output directory. Must exist. Required always

Encrypt mode:
 -e
    Obvs we want to turn on encrypt mode
 -u <username>
    Username to pass to gpg -u <username>
    Maybe read GPG's manual if you don't know what this is
    Required always in encrypt mode

 Fun facts:
  - Contents of the output directory will be overwritten
  - I ran out of things to say. Oops!

Decrypt mode:
 -d
    Obvs we want to turn on decrypt mode
 -p <passphrase file>
    Text file that contains your passphrase
    This is handed to gpg --passphrase-file <passphrase file>
    Maybe read GPG's manual if you don't know what this is
    Required always in decrypt mode

 Fun facts:
  - I coded in a Jedi joke
  - GPG is annoying because you cannot turn off the summary of your key
  - Contents of the output directory will be overwritten
  - If you try to use encrypt mode and decrypt mode, you're an idiet

Other things I have:
 -h
    You're probably surprised by this, but I wrote a manual
 -v
    Turns on verbosity
 -x
    Turns on extra verbosity
